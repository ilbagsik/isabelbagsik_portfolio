<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hi there, Isabel Bagsik, here! 

</br>
</br>My last name actually means “fierce” in my birth country, the Philippines, so I like to think that I got a little bit of that fire in me. I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Davis with a B.A. in Design (Visual Communication) and a B.A. in Technocultural Studies (a.k.a. Cinema and Digital Media). 

</br>
</br>I am a sucker for anything related to “Rocky”, “Forrest Gump”, “Back to the Future”, or Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Did I mention that I was highly involved with the Filipinx American community at UC Davis, immersing myself into the social justice and activist community, which led me to be interested in social design? 

</br>
</br>I also believe that self-expression is an important aspect to practice for yourself, whatever that form means to you. 
    
</br>    
</br>Ah yes, I almost forgot...besides design, I also exercise my creativity through my <a target="_blank" href="http://unconventionalblisss.blogspot.com"/>fashion blog</a>.
</p>
